## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to create an automated system for detecting diseases and nutrient deficiencies in lettuce crops. This system leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images of lettuce leaves.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the notebook:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

or you can use requirements.txt

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Preparation

The data preparation section includes:

- Loading the dataset
- Data augmentation
- Splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets

## Model Building

The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The key layers include:

- Convolutional layers
- Pooling layers
- Fully connected (Dense) layers
- Dropout layers for regularization

## Training

The training process involves:

- Defining the loss function and optimizer
- Training the model on the training set
- Validating the model on the validation set

## Evaluation

Post-training, the model is evaluated on the test set to assess its performance. Key metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of building and deploying a machine learning model for detecting diseases and nutrient deficiencies in lettuce. The use of TensorFlow Lite enables the deployment of the model on resource-constrained edge devices, facilitating real-time monitoring in agricultural settings.
